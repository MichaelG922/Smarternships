# Smarternships

Develop an app that allows companies to easily reach out to a talented student pool to
complete small "internships". The model would work like Fiverr where the students would
set up a profile with their experience and what kind of work, they are open to. Then
companies that need to contract out a small role for a piece of a project could search the
skillset they want and then see what students show up. For example, if a student is a
graphic designer, they can create a small portfolio with several tasks they would be open to.
Then a company that needs help with creating a graphic can choose the student that fits
their criteria the most and hire them for a week/month/semester. This app would be
beneficial for students because they may be able to make money from it and gain work
experience. This would benefit the company posting it because they could quickly get small
tasks done for less than a professional while giving back to the future workforce.

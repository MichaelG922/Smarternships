## Overview
Smarternships operates as a marketplace where students can offer their skills for small internship projects, similar to how freelancing platforms work. Students create profiles showcasing their abilities and availability, while companies can quickly find and hire talent for specific tasks or short-term roles.

Smarternships is an app that allows companies to easily reach out to a talented student pool to complete small "internships". The model works like Fiverr where students set up profiles with their experience and what kind of work they are open to. Companies that need to contract out a small role for a piece of a project can search the skillset they want and see what students show up. For example, if a student is a graphic designer, they can create a small portfolio with several tasks they would be open to. Then a company that needs help with creating a graphic can choose the student that fits their criteria the most and hire them for a week/month/semester. This app would be beneficial for students because they may be able to make money from it and gain work experience. This would benefit the company posting it because they could quickly get small tasks done for less than a professional while giving back to the future workforce.

## How It Works

**For Students:**
- Create a profile highlighting skills and experience
- Set up a portfolio with examples of work they're willing to take on
- Specify availability (week, month, semester)
- Get paid while gaining real work experience

**For Companies:**
- Search for students by skillset
- Review profiles and portfolios
- Hire students for specific projects or tasks
- Access affordable talent while supporting student development

## Example Use Case
A company needs graphic design work but doesn't require a full-time designer. They can search for graphic design students on the platform, review portfolios, and hire someone for a week or month to complete their project.

## Benefits

- **Companies**: Complete small tasks cost-effectively while contributing to workforce development
- **Everyone**: Flexible, project-based arrangements that fit different schedules and needs

## Overview

Smarternships operates as a marketplace where students can offer their skills for small internship projects, similar to how freelancing platforms work. Students create profiles showcasing their abilities and availability, while companies can quickly find and hire talent for specific tasks or short-term roles.

## How It Works

**For Students:**
- Create a profile highlighting skills and experience
- Set up a portfolio with examples of work they're willing to take on
- Specify availability (week, month, semester)
- Get paid while gaining real work experience

**For Companies:**
- Search for students by skillset
- Review profiles and portfolios
- Hire students for specific projects or tasks
- Access affordable talent while supporting student development

## Example Use Case

A company needs graphic design work but doesn't require a full-time designer. They can search for graphic design students on the platform, review portfolios, and hire someone for a week or month to complete their project.

## Benefits

- **Students**: Earn money and gain practical work experience
- **Companies**: Complete small tasks cost-effectively while contributing to workforce development
- **Everyone**: Flexible, project-based arrangements that fit different schedules and needs
